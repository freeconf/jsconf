# FreeCONF JavaScript driver
This connects to any RESTCONF server and coordinates the RESTCONF operations.  It has benefits over straight REST calls because it loads the YANG as well and provides you with a model-driven API that can validate your calls client-side.

## Future
Progress is being made to allow this to work in NodeJS as well letting you build RESTCONF compliant servers.
